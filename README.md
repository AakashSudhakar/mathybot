# The Wolfy Bot. :wolf:

### Created and maintained by Aakash Sudhakar (2019).

The **WolfyBot** is a tutorial-based Slack utility that allows for direct natural-language-driven communication between Slack users and the Wolfram mathematical database. 

A Slack user can simply ask a question to **WolfyBot** and it will respond within seconds with a curated, dynamic answer from the web!

This project was built and maintained for the Make School Product College course *Back-End Web 2.5*, focusing in Golang development. 

`NOTE`: This project makes use of several APIs, including Slack, Wolfram|Alpha, and Wit.ai. In order to clone and make full use of this project, you will need to sign up for developer accounts and access personal API keys for all three toolsets.
